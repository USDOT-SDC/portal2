### Setting Auth For Testing

Based on initial testing, do the following:

1. In the network tab, copy the contents of the Authorization Header from a successful call, most easily `get_user_info`. Do not copy the "Bearer " section at the start. 
2. In Bruno, go to the Auth section in your test and make sure Bearer Token is selected.
3. Paste the token.
