                                    <i>Technical Session</i> - Once a user is familiar with the layout of the SDC system and is ready to access data, the SDC Support Team will conduct a technical session to demonstrate how the user can start analyzing the requested dataset. This technical session, about 30-60 minutes in length, will include the following:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>How to access the data that has been made available? </li>
                                        <li>What tools/scripts are available for this dataset? </li>
                                        <li>What additional information about the dataset is available? </li>

                            <h6>Non-Standard Workstation Access</h6>
                            <p>If the user requires specialized tools, programming capabilities, or operating systems that are not offered by the standard SDC workstations, the SDC Support Team will investigate the following:</p>
                            <ul class="mb-3">
                                <li>Availability of the requested tool/programming capability (open-source versus licensed). </li>
                                <li>If open-source, what are the required dependencies for the tool and can it be installed on the SDC system?</li>
                                <li>If licensed software, the user is responsible for providing a license. The SDC team will walk through how best to install the licensed software to the user's workstation.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Once a determination is made on whether the userâ€™s needs can be supported within the SDC system, the SDC support team will communicate directly with the user notifying them of the ability/inability to provide the requested workstation tools. This will occur prior to the walkthrough and immediately after the user submits the access form. Ideally, the SDC team will work with the user to determine acceptable alternatives to the user. Once an alternative has been selected, the SDC support team will provision the workstation according to the agreed-upon specifications.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-4">

                            <p>Once the walkthrough of the system is complete, the SDC Support Team will check-in with the user (via email) within a week of the technical session to ensure that their use of the SDC system is going smoothly. In the email, the user will be pointed to available resources and an email point of contact for additional needs from the SDC Support Team. </p>

                        <li>
                            <h6>Raw Datasets</h6>
                            <p>The data stored in its native or original format are referred to as raw datasets. These datasets could be in structured (such as databases, logs, or financial data), semi-structured (HTML, XML, RDF, CSV) and un-structured (images, PDF, Word documents). This data is unaltered and stored as-is. The data can be received through continuous streaming sources (APIs, sensors) or one-time load from external sources.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h6>Curated Datasets</h6>
                            <p>Data curation is a process of integrating the raw data collected from various sources, annotating the data and presenting it in such a way that the value of the data is maintained over time and the data remains available for reuse and preservation. Curated datasets enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality, add value and provide for re-use over time, for researchers and data scientists. The curation process includes data transformations from unstructured and semi-structured formats to a structured format, deduplication of data, data obfuscation, and data cleaning, providing high-quality data for researchers to create meaningful insights.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Published Datasets</h6>
                            <p>Published datasets are created by researchers to disseminate their research for other users to verify and reuse them beyond the original purpose for which they were collected. Published datasets are a result of combining analysis on curated datasets available in SDC platform along with other datasets or algorithms that is owned/created by a researcher or data scientist.</p>
